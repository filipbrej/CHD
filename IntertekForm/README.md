## Getting Started

Welcome! To get started with the project, open the .xcworkspace file in XCode
(not .xcproject! If you open .xcproject, your code will not compile).

### Managing Dependencies with CocoaPods

CocoaPods offers easy and fast integration to manage dependencies. Install it like so:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Move inside your iOS project folder and run

```
pod install
```
